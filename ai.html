            AI-Generated: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life Beyond Earth
        </h1>
    
        <h2>Exoplanets and Habitable Zones</h2>
        <p>
            Exoplanets are planets that exist outside our solar system. Scientists are actively searching for exoplanets within habitable zones - regions around stars where conditions might be right for liquid water and, potentially, life. These discoveries expand our understanding of potential life-bearing worlds.

        <h2>Mars Exploration</h2>
        <p>
            Mars has long been a focus of planetary exploration due to its similarities to Earth. Ongoing missions, such as the Mars rovers, are designed to investigate the planet's surface, geology, and potential past or present microbial life. Mars represents a crucial step in our search for extraterrestrial life.

        <h2>Europa and Enceladus</h2>
        <p>
            Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, have captured the attention of scientists due to the possibility of subsurface oceans beneath their icy shells. These oceans could provide the necessary conditions for life, and future missions aim to explore these intriguing environments.
